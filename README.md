This repo is available using: 
- [README.md](https://nian0bussou.github.io/toshi-no-doukutu/)
- [resume page](https://nian0bussou.github.io/toshi-no-doukutu/resume)
- [game of life (is working, but is ***EXTREMELY slow***)](https://nian0bussou.github.io/toshi-no-doukutu/game)

I heavily suggest to start it using Go server (see Makefile)

**However, do not expect it to work as great**
